# Variables & Data Types

The foundation of everything in JavaScript. Get this right, and you'll avoid 90% of common bugs.

## The Golden Rule: const First, let When Necessary

```javascript
const name = "Sarah";        // Can't be reassigned 
const age = 25;              // Can't be reassigned 
let score = 0;               // Can be reassigned 
score = 10;                  // This works

const user = { name: "Tom" };
user.name = "Jerry";         // This works! const prevents reassignment, not mutation
```

**In React:** You'll use `const` for almost everything. Components, props, most variables - all `const`.

## var: Don't Use It

```javascript
var x = 10;  // L Avoid this
```

`var` has weird scoping rules that cause bugs. Pretend it doesn't exist. Modern JavaScript uses `const` and `let`.

## Data Types You'll Actually Use

### Strings

```javascript
const firstName = "John";
const lastName = 'Doe';

// Template literals - you'll use these constantly in React
const greeting = `Hello, ${firstName} ${lastName}!`;
const multiLine = `
  This spans
  multiple lines
`;
```

### Numbers

```javascript
const age = 25;
const price = 19.99;
const total = age + price;  // 44.99
```

### Booleans

```javascript
const isLoggedIn = true;
const hasAccess = false;

// In React JSX:
// {isLoggedIn && <Dashboard />}
```

### Arrays

```javascript
const colors = ["red", "blue", "green"];
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const mixed = [1, "two", true];  // Valid, but avoid mixing types
```

### Objects

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  isAdmin: true
};

// Accessing properties
console.log(user.name);        // "Alice"
console.log(user["age"]);      // 30
```

### null & undefined

```javascript
let data = null;           // Intentionally empty
let notAssigned;           // undefined (not initialized)

// In React, you'll often check for these:
if (data === null) {
  // Show loading state
}
```

## Template Literals: Your New Best Friend

Instead of this mess:

```javascript
const name = "Sarah";
const age = 25;
const message = "Hello, " + name + "! You are " + age + " years old.";
```

Write this:

```javascript
const name = "Sarah";
const age = 25;
const message = `Hello, ${name}! You are ${age} years old.`;
```

**React example:**

```jsx
function Greeting({ name, time }) {
  return <h1>{`Good ${time}, ${name}!`}</h1>;
}
```

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Trying to reassign const

```javascript
const count = 0;
count = 1;  // L Error: Assignment to constant variable
```

**Fix:** Use `let` if you need to reassign:

```javascript
let count = 0;
count = 1;  //  Works
```

### 2. Confusing const with immutability

```javascript
const user = { name: "Tom" };
user.name = "Jerry";  //  This works!
user = { name: "Spike" };  // L This doesn't
```

`const` prevents **reassignment**, not **mutation**. You can change object properties.

### 3. Forgetting quotes in strings

```javascript
const name = Alice;  // L Error: Alice is not defined
const name = "Alice";  //  Correct
```

## Interview Questions

<details>
<summary>Q1: What's the difference between const, let, and var?</summary>

**Answer:**
- `const`: Cannot be reassigned, block-scoped. Use this by default.
- `let`: Can be reassigned, block-scoped. Use when you need to change the value.
- `var`: Can be reassigned, function-scoped (not block-scoped). Avoid in modern JavaScript.

**Example:**
```javascript
{
  const x = 1;
  let y = 2;
  var z = 3;
}
console.log(x);  // Error: x is not defined
console.log(y);  // Error: y is not defined
console.log(z);  // 3 (var leaks out of block scope!)
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q2: Can you change the properties of a const object?</summary>

**Answer:** Yes! `const` prevents reassignment of the variable itself, but you can still modify the object's properties.

```javascript
const user = { name: "Tom" };
user.name = "Jerry";      //  Allowed
user.age = 25;            //  Allowed
user = { name: "Spike" }; // L Error: Assignment to constant
```

To make an object truly immutable, use `Object.freeze()`:
```javascript
const user = Object.freeze({ name: "Tom" });
user.name = "Jerry";  // Silently fails (throws error in strict mode)
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q3: What are template literals and why use them?</summary>

**Answer:** Template literals use backticks (\`) and allow you to embed expressions with `${}`. They're cleaner than string concatenation.

**Without template literals:**
```javascript
const name = "Alice";
const age = 25;
const msg = "Hello, " + name + "! You are " + age + " years old.";
```

**With template literals:**
```javascript
const msg = `Hello, ${name}! You are ${age} years old.`;
```

Benefits:
- Easier to read
- Support multi-line strings without `\n`
- Can include expressions: `${age + 1}`
</details>

## Key Takeaways

1. Always use `const` by default. Only use `let` when you need to reassign.
2. Never use `var`.
3. `const` prevents reassignment, not mutation of objects/arrays.
4. Template literals (`backticks`) make string interpolation much cleaner.
5. Know your types: string, number, boolean, array, object, null, undefined.
