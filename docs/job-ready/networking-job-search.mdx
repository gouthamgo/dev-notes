# Networking & Job Search Strategies

Here's the truth about job searching: 70-80% of jobs are never posted publicly. They're filled through referrals, connections, and networks. If you're only applying to job boards, you're competing for 20-30% of opportunities with 100% of other applicants.

This guide will show you how to access the hidden job market and build genuine connections that help your career long after you land your next role.

## The Reality of the Job Market

Let's bust some myths:

**Myth:** "Just apply online and wait for responses"
**Reality:** Online applications have a 1-5% response rate

**Myth:** "Networking is about using people"
**Reality:** Networking is about building genuine, mutually beneficial relationships

**Myth:** "I need to attend every networking event"
**Reality:** Quality connections > quantity of contacts

**Myth:** "I'm not good at networking"
**Reality:** Networking is a skill anyone can learn

**The Hidden Job Market:**
- 70-80% of jobs are filled through referrals
- Many positions are filled before they're posted
- Referrals are 4x more likely to get hired
- Referred candidates interview faster

Your goal: Access this hidden market through strategic networking and job search.

## Part 1: Building Your Network

### Start With What You Have

You have more connections than you think.

**Your Existing Network:**
- Former colleagues and classmates
- Bootcamp/university alumni
- Friends and family
- Social media connections
- Community members
- Teachers and mentors
- People you've met at meetups

**Exercise: Network Mapping**

Create three lists:

**Strong Ties (People you know well):**
```
1. Former coworker at ABC Company
2. Bootcamp cohort mate
3. College friend in tech
4. Neighbor who's a developer
5. ...
```

**Weak Ties (People you've met but don't know well):**
```
1. Person I met at a meetup
2. LinkedIn connection from online course
3. Person who commented on my GitHub
4. Former manager from 5 years ago
5. ...
```

**Aspirational Connections (People you'd like to know):**
```
1. Senior developer at dream company
2. Tech blogger I follow
3. Speaker from conference
4. Open source maintainer
5. ...
```

Start with strong ties. They're most likely to help.

### The 3-2-1 Weekly Networking System

Consistent, small efforts compound over time.

**Every Week:**
- **3 Genuine Interactions:** Comment thoughtfully on 3 LinkedIn posts
- **2 Reach Outs:** Send 2 connection requests or messages
- **1 Deeper Conversation:** Have 1 coffee chat or call

That's it. Just 3-2-1 every week.

**Example Week:**

**Monday (3 Genuine Interactions):**
- Comment on a former colleague's post about their new project
- Share thoughts on a technical article someone posted
- Congratulate a connection on their work anniversary

**Wednesday (2 Reach Outs):**
- Message: "Hi Sarah, noticed we both worked at TechCorp. How's the new role at StartupXYZ?"
- Connection request to a developer at a company you're interested in

**Friday (1 Deeper Conversation):**
- 30-minute coffee chat with a bootcamp alumnus

**Why This Works:**
- Not overwhelming (30 minutes total weekly)
- Builds consistency
- Creates genuine touchpoints
- Compounds over time

### How to Make Great Connection Requests

Generic LinkedIn requests get ignored. Personalized ones get accepted.

**Bad Connection Request:**
```
Hi, I'd like to connect with you on LinkedIn.
```

**Good Connection Request:**

```
Hi Sarah,

I saw your post about optimizing React performance and loved your
approach to using React.memo. I'm a junior developer working on
similar challenges.

Would love to connect and follow your insights!

Best,
Mike
```

**Great Connection Request:**

```
Hi Sarah,

I'm a developer at [Company] working with React. I came across your
article on "Advanced React Patterns" and it helped me solve a complex
state management issue we were facing.

I'd love to connect and learn from your experience. I'm particularly
interested in frontend architecture, which I see is your focus.

Thanks,
Mike
```

**Connection Request Formula:**

```
1. Specific reason you're reaching out
2. Common ground or context
3. Brief about you (if needed)
4. What you hope to gain/offer
```

**Who to Connect With:**
- Developers at companies you're interested in
- People in roles you want
- Alumni from your school/bootcamp
- People who engage with your content
- Speakers at events you attend
- Open source contributors in your space

### The Art of the Coffee Chat

Coffee chats are the most valuable networking activity. Here's how to do them right.

**How to Ask:**

**Bad:**
```
Can I pick your brain about getting a job?
```

**Good:**
```
Hi Sarah,

I'm a junior developer transitioning into frontend work, and I've been
impressed by your career path from bootcamp grad to senior engineer at
TechCorp.

Would you have 20-30 minutes in the next few weeks for a virtual coffee?
I'd love to hear about your experience and any advice you might have for
someone early in their career.

I'm happy to work around your schedule!

Thanks,
Mike
```

**Why This Works:**
- Specific about what you want
- Respectful of their time (20-30 min)
- Acknowledges their experience
- Shows you've done research
- Offers flexibility

**Coffee Chat Structure (30 minutes):**

**Minutes 0-5: Small Talk & Context**
- Thank them for their time
- Brief introduction (30 seconds)
- Build rapport

**Minutes 5-25: Ask Great Questions**
- Prepared questions about their experience
- Listen actively
- Follow up on interesting points
- Take notes

**Minutes 25-30: Wrap Up & Next Steps**
- Thank them again
- Ask if you can stay in touch
- Mention specific next steps
- Offer to help them if possible

**Great Coffee Chat Questions:**

**About Their Career:**
- How did you get into development?
- What was your first role like?
- What skills have been most valuable?
- What do you wish you'd known earlier?

**About Their Company:**
- What's the culture like at [Company]?
- How does your team work together?
- What technologies are you most excited about?
- How do you approach professional development?

**For Advice:**
- What would you focus on if you were starting today?
- How did you choose between different opportunities?
- What resources have been most helpful to you?
- Are there any books/blogs/courses you'd recommend?

**Avoid:**
- Asking them to refer you (not yet)
- Treating it like an interview
- Talking more than listening
- Not being prepared
- Being late or unprofessional

**After the Coffee Chat:**

Send a thank you within 24 hours:

```
Hi Sarah,

Thank you so much for taking the time to chat yesterday! Your advice
about focusing on fundamentals before frameworks really resonated with
me, and I've already started working through the resources you suggested.

I especially appreciated hearing about your transition from bootcamp to
your first role. It's encouraging to see what's possible with consistent
effort.

I'd love to stay in touch and keep you posted on my progress. And if
there's ever anything I can help you with, please don't hesitate to ask!

Thanks again,
Mike
```

**Follow Up:**
- Connect on LinkedIn (if you haven't)
- Update them occasionally on your progress
- Share relevant articles or resources
- Be a genuine connection, not transactional

### Networking Events: How to Make Them Work

Networking events can be valuable or a waste of time. Here's how to make them valuable.

**Before the Event:**
- Research who's attending (if possible)
- Prepare your introduction (30-second version)
- Set a goal (3 meaningful conversations)
- Bring business cards or have LinkedIn ready
- Plan what you'll wear (neat and professional)

**Your 30-Second Introduction:**

**Bad:**
```
Hi, I'm Mike. I'm a developer looking for a job.
```

**Good:**
```
Hi, I'm Mike. I'm a full-stack developer passionate about building
accessible web applications. I recently built a project management app
that helps remote teams collaborate more effectively. What do you work on?
```

**Formula:**
```
Name + What you do + Specific interest/project + Question for them
```

**At the Event:**

**Do:**
- Smile and make eye contact
- Ask questions and listen
- Take notes after conversations
- Be genuine and curious
- Help connect people ("You should meet...")
- Follow up on interesting discussions
- Respect people's time

**Don't:**
- Immediately pitch yourself
- Collect business cards without talking
- Dominate conversations
- Drink too much
- Interrupt or be pushy
- Stay in one conversation all night
- Forget to follow up

**The 3-Person Strategy:**

At any event, aim to:
1. Have one deep conversation (15-20 minutes)
2. Have two medium conversations (5-10 minutes)
3. Have several brief exchanges (2-3 minutes)

Quality > quantity.

**After the Event:**

Follow up within 48 hours:

```
Hi Sarah,

It was great meeting you at the React meetup last night! I really
enjoyed our conversation about state management patterns.

I checked out the article you mentioned about Zustand, and it's
exactly what I needed for my current project.

Would love to stay connected and continue the conversation. Let me
know if you're at next month's meetup!

Best,
Mike
```

## Part 2: Job Search Strategies

### The Three-Channel Approach

Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Use three channels simultaneously:

**Channel 1: Direct Applications (20% of time)**
- Job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.)
- Company career pages
- Remote job sites (We Work Remotely, Remote.co)

**Channel 2: Referrals & Networking (60% of time)**
- Reach out to connections at target companies
- Ask for informational interviews
- Attend meetups and events
- Engage on LinkedIn
- Build relationships

**Channel 3: Recruiters & Agencies (20% of time)**
- Connect with tech recruiters
- Work with agencies
- Respond to InMail
- Build recruiter relationships

**Why 60% on networking?** Because it has the highest ROI for time invested.

### Creating Your Target Company List

Don't spray and pray. Be strategic.

**Step 1: List 30-50 Companies**

**Categories to Consider:**
- Companies using your preferred tech stack
- Companies solving problems you care about
- Companies with good culture fit
- Companies with strong engineering teams
- Companies in your desired location
- Companies at your desired stage (startup vs. enterprise)

**Where to Find Companies:**
- LinkedIn job search
- Built In [Your City]
- Crunchbase
- Y Combinator companies
- Stack Overflow job listings
- GitHub Jobs archive
- Angel List / Wellfound

**Step 2: Prioritize Your List**

Tier 1 (Dream Companies): 10 companies
Tier 2 (Strong Interest): 20 companies
Tier 3 (Good Options): 20 companies

**Step 3: Research Each Company**

For each company, document:
```
Company: Acme Corp
Stage: Series B
Size: 150 employees
Tech Stack: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS
Recent News: Just raised $20M, expanding team
Connection: Alumni from my bootcamp works there
Culture: Remote-first, emphasizes work-life balance
Job Openings: 2 frontend roles, 1 full-stack
Next Steps: Reach out to alumni connection
```

**Step 4: Create an Action Plan**

For each Tier 1 company:
- Find 2-3 employees to connect with
- Follow company on LinkedIn
- Engage with their content
- Apply directly if there's a posting
- Try to get a referral

### The Application Strategy

Applications aren't just about filling out forms. Be strategic.

**Before You Apply:**

1. **Research the Role:**
   - Read the job description 3 times
   - Identify required vs. nice-to-have skills
   - Understand what they're really looking for
   - Note the technologies mentioned

2. **Find a Connection:**
   - Search LinkedIn for employees
   - Look for alumni or mutual connections

- Thank them for their help

**Don't:**

**First Call with a Recruiter:**

They'll ask about:

- Your timeline
- Your location/remote preferences

**Be prepared to discuss:**

**Good Recruiter Relationships:**
- Check in every few months
- Update them on your career
- Refer other candidates to them
- Be professional and grateful
- Keep the relationship long-term

### The Application Tracking System

Don't just apply randomly. Track everything.

- Notes and feedback

**Why Track:**
- Prevents duplicate applications
- Helps you follow up appropriately
- Shows your progress
- Identifies patterns
- Keeps you organized
- Reduces stress

### How Many Applications Should You Send?

**The Numbers Game:**

If you're applying only online:
- Apply to 50-100 positions
- Expect 1-5% response rate
- That's 2-5 interviews
- Need 1 offer

If you're using referrals:
- Apply to 20-30 positions
- Expect 20-40% response rate
- That's 6-12 interviews
- Need 1 offer

**Recommended Weekly Activity:**

**If Actively Job Searching:**
- 10-15 tailored applications
- 10 networking conversations
- 5 LinkedIn engagements per day
- 2-3 coffee chats
- 1-2 meetup/event attendances

**If Passively Looking:**
- 3-5 applications to dream roles
- 5 networking touchpoints
- 1 coffee chat
- Consistent LinkedIn presence

### Dealing with Rejection

Rejection is part of the process. Everyone faces it.

**Types of Rejection:**

**1. No Response (Most Common)**
- Don't take it personally
- Follow up once after 2 weeks
- Move on if still no response

**2. Automated Rejection**
- Usually means ATS filtered you out
- Review your resume keywords
- Try to get a referral next time

**3. After Phone Screen**
- Ask for feedback (politely)
- Thank them for their time
- Learn from the experience

**4. After Technical Interview**
- Definitely ask for feedback
- Review what went wrong
- Practice those areas
- It happens to everyone

**5. After Final Round**
- Always ask for detailed feedback
- This is valuable information
- Stay in touch with the team
- Ask to be considered for future roles

**How to Ask for Feedback:**

```
Hi Sarah,

Thank you for considering me for the Frontend Developer role. While
I'm disappointed, I appreciate the time your team invested in my
interview process.

Would you be able to share any feedback about my interview performance?
I'm always looking to improve, and specific insights would be incredibly
valuable for my growth as a developer.

Thanks again for the opportunity. I hope we can stay in touch, and I'd
love to be considered for future roles that might be a better fit.

Best,
Mike
```

**Dealing with Rejection Emotionally:**

**Do:**
- Take a break (few hours or a day)
- Talk to friends or mentor
- Review what you learned
- Focus on what you can control
- Keep perspective (one rejection ≠ failure)
- Celebrate the experience gained

**Don't:**
- Burn bridges (respond professionally)
- Give up after a few rejections
- Take it personally
- Compare yourself to others
- Stop networking
- Lose confidence

**Remember:**
- The average job search takes 3-6 months
- Most people apply to 50-100+ jobs
- Every "no" gets you closer to "yes"
- Rejection is data, not judgment
- Your worth ≠ interview performance

### Job Search Time Management

Job searching is a full-time job (or a significant part-time commitment).

**If Unemployed (40 hours/week):**

**Monday-Friday:**
- 8-10am: Coffee, review opportunities, plan day
- 10am-12pm: Applications (2-3 tailored applications)
- 12-1pm: Lunch, walk, break
- 1-3pm: Networking (LinkedIn, messages, research)
- 3-4pm: Skill building (coding, projects)
- 4-5pm: Admin (track applications, follow ups)

**Plus:**
- 2-3 coffee chats per week
- 1-2 networking events per week
- Daily LinkedIn engagement

**If Employed (10-15 hours/week):**

**Weekday Evenings (1-2 hours):**
- Applications or networking

**Weekend (6-8 hours):**
- Saturday: Applications, networking, LinkedIn
- Sunday: Skill building, projects, prep

**Stay Consistent:**
- Set a schedule and stick to it
- Treat it like a job
- Take weekends when you need to
- Track your time and results
- Adjust based on what works

### Job Search Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Only Applying Online**
- Lowest success rate
- Most competition
- Easy to get discouraged

**Solution:** 60% networking, 20% applications, 20% recruiters

**2. Generic Applications**
- Easy to spot
- Shows lack of effort
- Low response rate

**Solution:** Tailor every application

**3. Not Following Up**
- Missed opportunities
- Shows lack of interest
- Easy to stand out by following up

**Solution:** Follow up once, appropriately timed

**4. Poor LinkedIn Presence**
- Recruiters can't find you
- Doesn't showcase your brand
- Missing networking opportunities

**Solution:** Optimize profile (see LinkedIn guide)

**5. Neglecting Projects**
- Nothing to show in interviews
- Can't demonstrate skills
- Weak portfolio

**Solution:** Build 3-5 strong projects

**6. Not Networking**
- Miss hidden opportunities
- No referrals
- Longer job search

**Solution:** 3-2-1 system (see above)

**7. Getting Discouraged**
- Apply less
- Lower quality applications
- Bad energy in interviews

**Solution:** Set realistic expectations, take breaks, celebrate small wins

**8. Burning Bridges**
- Ruins future opportunities
- Bad reputation
- Limits network

**Solution:** Always be professional, even when frustrated

## Part 3: Informational Interviews

Informational interviews are the secret weapon of successful job seekers.

### What Are Informational Interviews?

**Not:**
- Job interviews
- Asking for a job
- Pitching yourself

**Are:**
- Learning conversations
- Building relationships
- Gathering information
- Understanding companies/roles

### How to Request One

```

**Key Elements:**

**About Their Company:**
- What's the engineering culture like?
- How does the team collaborate?
- What's the tech stack and why?
- How does the company support professional development?
- What makes someone successful at your company?

**About the Industry:**
- What trends are you seeing?
- What skills are becoming more important?
- What advice would you give someone entering the field?
- What resources do you recommend?

**About Your Situation:**
- Given my background [brief description], what roles should I consider?
- What skills should I focus on developing?
- Are there companies I should look at?
- Is there anyone else you'd recommend I talk to?

### After the Informational Interview

**Send Thank You (Within 24 hours):**

```
Hi Sarah,

Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me yesterday about
your path to engineering management. Your insights about building
leadership skills while still in an IC role were especially valuable.

I've already started implementing your advice about taking on more
mentorship opportunities on my current team.

I really appreciate you offering to introduce me to other engineering
managers. If you think of anyone who might be willing to chat, I'd be
grateful for the connection.

Thanks again for your time and generosity!

Best,
Mike
```

**Stay in Touch:**
- Connect on LinkedIn
- Update them on your progress (3-6 months)
- Share relevant articles
- Offer to help if you can
- Be a genuine connection

**If It Goes Really Well:**

You might mention (naturally):
> "If you hear of any opportunities that might be a fit, I'd love if
> you'd keep me in mind."

But DON'T:
- Ask for a job directly
- Push for a referral
- Make them uncomfortable
- Expect anything in return
