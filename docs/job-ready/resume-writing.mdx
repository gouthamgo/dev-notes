# Resume Writing for Developers

Your resume is often your first impression with a potential employer. In the competitive tech job market, you typically have 6-10 seconds to grab a recruiter's attention before they move on. This guide will help you create a resume that stands out for the right reasons.

## The Reality of Resume Screening

Before we dive into how to write a great resume, let's understand what happens to it:

1. **ATS (Applicant Tracking System)** - Software scans your resume for keywords and formatting
2. **First Recruiter Screen** - 6-10 seconds to decide if you're worth a closer look
3. **Detailed Review** - 30-60 seconds to determine if you get an interview
4. **Interview Prep** - Hiring team reviews it before meeting you

Your resume needs to succeed at ALL these stages.

## The Developer Resume Structure

Here's the order that works best for most developers:

```
1. Header (Name, Contact Info, Links)
2. Summary/Objective (Optional, but recommended for career changers)
3. Technical Skills
4. Professional Experience
5. Projects (Critical for junior developers)
6. Education
7. Additional Sections (Certifications, Awards, etc.)
```

Let's break down each section.

## 1. Header: Make It Easy to Contact You

### Good Example:
```
SARAH CHEN
Full Stack Developer
sarah.chen@email.com | (555) 123-4567 | Portland, OR
linkedin.com/in/sarahchen | github.com/sarahchen | sarahchen.dev
```

### Bad Example:
```
Sarah Chen
123 Main Street, Apt 4B, Portland, OR 97201
Home: (555) 123-4567 | Cell: (555) 987-6543
sarahchen_coolcoder@email.com
```

**Why the first is better:**
- Clean, professional email
- One phone number (not two)
- No full address needed (city/state is enough)
- Links to professional profiles
- Clear job title

**Common Mistakes:**
- Unprofessional email addresses (coolcoder123@email.com)
- Missing GitHub link
- Broken or incomplete LinkedIn URLs
- Including unnecessary personal info (age, photo, marital status)

## 2. Summary/Objective: Your Elevator Pitch

For career changers and junior developers, a 2-3 sentence summary can provide context. For experienced developers, it's optional.

### Good Example (Career Changer):
```
Full-stack developer with 3 years of project management experience
transitioning to software development. Completed 500+ hours of coding
in React, Node.js, and MongoDB. Passionate about building accessible,
user-focused web applications. Seeking frontend or full-stack role
where I can leverage both technical and project management skills.
```

### Good Example (Junior Developer):
```
Recent Computer Science graduate with hands-on experience building
modern web applications using React, TypeScript, and AWS. Strong
foundation in data structures, algorithms, and software design
patterns. Contributed to 2 open-source projects with 1000+ stars.
```

### Bad Example:
```
Hardworking and motivated developer seeking a challenging position
where I can grow my skills and make a difference. Team player with
excellent communication skills and a passion for technology.
```

**Why the bad example fails:**
- Generic buzzwords ("hardworking", "motivated", "team player")
- No specific skills mentioned
- Doesn't differentiate you from anyone else
- Focuses on what you want, not what you offer

**Skip the summary if:**
- You have 3+ years of relevant experience
- Your work history clearly shows your expertise
- You need the space for more important content

## 3. Technical Skills: Pass the ATS

This section helps you pass ATS systems AND helps recruiters quickly see if you're a match.

### Good Example:
```
TECHNICAL SKILLS

Languages: JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, Python, HTML5, CSS3, SQL
Frontend: React, Redux, Next.js, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, Material-UI
Backend: Node.js, Express, Django, RESTful APIs, GraphQL
Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Firebase
Tools & DevOps: Git, Docker, AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda), CI/CD, Jest, Webpack
```

### Bad Example:
```
SKILLS

- Expert in JavaScript
- Proficient in React and Node
- Experienced with databases
- Familiar with cloud technologies
- Microsoft Office, Windows, Mac OS
```

**Why the first is better:**
- Organized by category
- Specific technologies, not vague categories
- Easy to scan quickly
- No subjective ratings ("expert", "proficient")
- No irrelevant skills (MS Office)

**Pro Tips:**
- Put your strongest skills first in each category
- Only include technologies you can discuss in an interview
- Don't lie about your experience level
- Update this section for each job application
- Include the specific technologies mentioned in the job description

**Avoid:**
- Skill bars or percentage ratings (highly subjective)
- Ranking skills as "expert" or "beginner" (let your experience speak)
- Including obvious skills (Microsoft Word, Email)
- Listing every technology you've touched once

## 4. Professional Experience: Show Impact, Not Just Duties

This is where most resumes fail or succeed. Don't just list what you did - show the impact you made.

### The Formula:

```
Action Verb + Specific Task + Measurable Result + Technology Used
```

### Good Example:

```
PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Software Engineer | TechStart Inc. | San Francisco, CA | June 2022 - Present

• Reduced page load time by 40% by implementing code splitting and lazy
  loading with React.lazy and Suspense, improving user retention by 15%

• Built and deployed a customer dashboard using React, TypeScript, and
  Node.js, serving 10,000+ daily active users with 99.9% uptime

• Collaborated with design team to implement responsive UI components
  with Tailwind CSS, reducing CSS bundle size by 30%

• Mentored 3 junior developers through code reviews and pair programming
  sessions, improving team code quality scores by 25%

• Integrated Stripe payment processing and automated invoice generation,
  reducing payment processing time from 3 days to real-time
```

### Bad Example:

```
PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Software Engineer | TechStart Inc. | San Francisco, CA | June 2022 - Present

• Worked on frontend development using React
• Participated in team meetings and code reviews
• Fixed bugs and implemented new features
• Collaborated with team members
• Wrote clean and maintainable code
```

**Why the first is better:**
- Quantifiable results (40%, 15%, 10,000+ users)
- Specific technologies mentioned
- Shows impact on business/users
- Demonstrates leadership (mentoring)
- Technical depth without being overwhelming

### Action Verbs for Developers:

**Building:**
- Architected, Built, Developed, Engineered, Implemented, Created, Designed

**Improving:**
- Optimized, Refactored, Enhanced, Improved, Reduced, Increased, Streamlined

**Leadership:**
- Led, Mentored, Guided, Coordinated, Drove, Spearheaded, Initiated

**Problem-Solving:**
- Debugged, Resolved, Troubleshot, Analyzed, Investigated, Fixed

**Collaboration:**
- Collaborated, Partnered, Integrated, Coordinated, Contributed

### How to Add Metrics (Even Without Direct Data):

Not everything is measurable, but you can often estimate or add context:

**Instead of:** "Built user authentication system"
**Try:** "Built JWT-based authentication system serving 5,000+ users with OAuth integration"

**Instead of:** "Improved application performance"
**Try:** "Reduced API response time by ~50% through database query optimization and caching"

**Instead of:** "Fixed bugs in production"
**Try:** "Resolved 20+ critical production bugs, reducing customer support tickets by 30%"

**Instead of:** "Wrote tests"
**Try:** "Increased test coverage from 45% to 80%, reducing production bugs by 25%"

## 5. Projects: Your Portfolio in Brief

For junior developers and career changers, projects are critical. They show you can build real things.

### Good Example:

```

## Common Resume Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Too Long or Too Short
- **One page** for &lt;5 years experience
- **Two pages** for 5+ years experience
- Never more than two pages

### 2. Poor Formatting
**Avoid:**
- Fancy fonts (use Arial, Calibri, or similar)
- Colors and graphics (ATS can't read them)
- Tables and columns (breaks in ATS)
- Headers and footers (ATS misses them)
- PDFs with images or fancy formatting

**Use:**
- Simple, clean format
- Consistent spacing
- Clear section headers
- Standard margins (0.5" - 1")
- Black text on white background

### 3. Typos and Grammar Errors
One typo can sink your application.

**How to catch them:**
- Read it backwards (seriously)
- Use Grammarly or similar tool
- Read it out loud
- Have 3+ people review it
- Take a break and review it fresh

### 4. Irrelevant Information
**Don't include:**
- Photo (unless common in your country)
- Age or date of birth
- Marital status
- Social Security number
- References (provide separately if asked)
- Unrelated hobbies
- "References available upon request"

### 5. Lying or Exaggerating
**Never lie about:**
- Degrees you don't have
- Companies you didn't work for
- Technologies you don't know
- Project scope or impact

It WILL come out in interviews or background checks.

**Instead:**
- Be honest about your level
- Use phrases like "Exposure to..." for technologies you've tried
- Focus on what you DID do and do well
- Let your real accomplishments shine

### 6. Using a Generic Resume for Every Application
Your resume should be tailored to each job.

**How to tailor:**
- Match keywords from job description
- Emphasize relevant experience
- Reorder skills to match their priorities
- Adjust your summary to align with role
- Include technologies they use

### 7. Focusing on Responsibilities Instead of Achievements
**Bad:** "Responsible for writing frontend code"
**Good:** "Built responsive React components serving 50,000+ daily users"

**Bad:** "Worked on the backend team"
**Good:** "Architected microservices backend handling 1M+ daily API requests"

## ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Tips

Most companies use ATS software to screen resumes. Here's how to beat it:

### 1. Use Standard Section Headers
**Good:**
- Work Experience
- Professional Experience
- Technical Skills
- Education

**Avoid:**
- Where I've Been
- What I Know
- My Journey

### 2. Include Keywords from the Job Description
If the job description says:
> "Looking for a React developer with experience in Redux, TypeScript, and RESTful APIs"

Your resume should include those exact terms.

### 3. Use Both Acronyms and Full Terms
- Include both "CI/CD" and "Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment"
- Write "PostgreSQL" not just "Postgres"
- Use "JavaScript" not just "JS"

### 4. Save as .docx or .pdf
- .docx is most ATS-friendly
- .pdf works for most modern ATS
- Never use .pages, .odt, or image files

### 5. Avoid Fancy Formatting
- No text boxes
- No tables
- No columns
- No headers/footers
- Simple bullet points

### 6. Use Standard Fonts
- Arial
- Calibri
- Georgia
- Times New Roman
- Helvetica

## The Two-File Strategy

Create two versions of your resume:

### Version 1: ATS-Optimized
- Simple formatting
- Keyword-rich
- .docx format
- Use for online applications

### Version 2: Human-Optimized
- Can have subtle design elements
- PDF format
- Slightly more visual
- Use for networking, referrals, bringing to interviews

Both should have the same content - just different presentation.

Your resume is a living document. It should:
- Evolve as you gain experience
- Be tailored for each application
- Tell a story about your growth
- Showcase your best work
- Be honest but compelling

Remember: A great resume doesn't get you the job - it gets you the interview. Your goal is to pass the ATS, intrigue the recruiter, and make the hiring manager want to talk to you.

Don't aim for perfection. Aim for clarity, impact, and authenticity. The rest will follow.

Now go update that resume. Your next opportunity is waiting.
