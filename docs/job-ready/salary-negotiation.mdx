# Salary Negotiation

Let's talk about something uncomfortable: money. Most developers leave tens of thousands of dollars on the table because they don't negotiate or don't negotiate well. This guide will help you understand your worth, navigate salary discussions, and negotiate with confidence.

## Why Negotiation Matters

Here's the math:

**Scenario 1: You Don't Negotiate**
- Initial offer: $90,000
- Annual raises: 3%
- 10-year earnings: $1,042,000

**Scenario 2: You Negotiate $10,000 Higher**
- Initial offer: $100,000
- Annual raises: 3%
- 10-year earnings: $1,158,000

**Difference: $116,000 over 10 years**

And that's just salary. It doesn't include:
- Higher 401k matches (percentage of salary)
- Higher bonuses (percentage of salary)
- Better starting point for future negotiations
- Compounding effect on entire career

**One conversation can change your financial trajectory.**

## The Mindset Shift

Before we dive into tactics, let's address the mental game.

### Common Fears and Truths

**Fear:** "If I negotiate, they'll rescind the offer"
**Truth:** Companies expect negotiation. Reasonable requests won't cost you the offer.

**Fear:** "I don't have leverage"
**Truth:** You have more leverage than you think. They chose YOU.

**Fear:** "I should just be grateful for any offer"
**Truth:** Gratitude and negotiation aren't mutually exclusive.

**Fear:** "Asking for more seems greedy"
**Truth:** Companies negotiate for themselves. You should too.

**Fear:** "I don't know what I'm worth"
**Truth:** We'll fix that in this guide.

### The Right Mindset

**Remember:**
- Negotiation is expected and normal
- You're not being difficult, you're being professional
- Companies have a range, not a fixed number
- The person making you an offer wants you to accept
- Negotiation is collaboration, not combat
- You're advocating for yourself, not being greedy

**The Goal:**
Not to "win" or maximize every dollar, but to reach a compensation package that:
- Reflects your value
- Meets your needs
- Feels fair
- Sets you up for success

## Understanding Your Market Value

You can't negotiate effectively without knowing what you're worth.

### Research Your Salary Range

**Best Resources:**

**Levels.fyi (Best for Tech)**
- Real, verified salary data
- Broken down by company, level, location
- Includes equity breakdown
- Shows total compensation

**Glassdoor**
- Large dataset
- Company-specific insights
- Less accurate than Levels.fyi but broader coverage

**Payscale**
- Customized salary reports
- Considers experience, skills, location

**LinkedIn Salary**
- Based on LinkedIn data
- Filtered by role, experience, location

**Built In (Local Markets)**
- Startup and tech company focused
- City-specific data

**Your Network**
- Talk to people in similar roles
- Bootcamp cohort mates
- Online communities

**Example Research Process:**

```
Role: Frontend Developer
Experience: 2 years
Location: Austin, TX
Tech Stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js

Research Results:
- Levels.fyi: $85k-$115k (50+ data points)
- Glassdoor: $80k-$110k
- Payscale: $78k-$105k
- LinkedIn: $82k-$112k
- Network: 2 people, $88k and $98k

Estimated Range: $85k-$110k
Target: $95k-$100k
Minimum: $85k
```

### Factors That Affect Your Value

**Increase Your Value:**
- High-demand skills (React, TypeScript, AWS)
- Relevant experience
- Strong portfolio
- Multiple competing offers
- High-cost-of-living area
- In-demand specialization
- Quantifiable achievements
- Advanced degree (sometimes)

**Decrease Your Value:**
- Career gaps (can be explained)
- Mismatched skills
- Low-cost-of-living area
- First job
- Career change
- Limited portfolio
- Weak interview performance

**Neither Good Nor Bad:**
- Bootcamp vs. CS degree (matters less than skills)
- Company prestige (varies by next opportunity)
- Previous salary (don't let it anchor you)

### Calculate Your Minimum

Before any negotiation, know your walk-away number.

**Calculate Your Needs:**

```
Monthly Expenses:
- Rent/Mortgage: $1,500
- Utilities: $200
- Food: $500
- Transportation: $300
- Insurance: $400
- Debt payments: $500
- Savings goal: $500
- Misc/Buffer: $300

Total Monthly: $4,200
Total Annual: $50,400

After taxes (~25%): $67,200 minimum

Adding 20% buffer: $80,640

My Minimum: $80,000
```

**Your minimum is not your target.**
It's your walk-away point.

## Understanding Total Compensation

Salary is just one part of your compensation package.

### Components of Total Compensation

**Base Salary**
- Your annual cash compensation
- Most important for most developers
- Guaranteed (barring job loss)

**Bonus**
- Annual or quarterly cash bonus
- Often percentage of salary (10-20%)
- May be performance-based
- Not guaranteed

**Equity/Stock Options**
- Ownership in the company
- Can be highly valuable or worthless
- Vesting schedule matters
- Different types (options, RSUs, etc.)

**Benefits**
- Health insurance (employer contribution)
- 401k match
- PTO/vacation days
- Parental leave
- Education budget
- Remote work options

**Perks**
- Flexible hours
- Remote work
- Equipment
- Conference budget
- Food/snacks
- Gym membership
- Commuter benefits

### Calculating Total Comp

**Example Offer:**

```
Base Salary: $100,000
Annual Bonus: $10,000 (10% target)
Stock Options: $20,000/year (4-year vest)
Health Insurance: $8,000/year (employer pays)
401k Match: $5,000/year (5% match)
PTO: 20 days
Education: $2,000/year

Total Cash: $110,000
Total Comp: $145,000
```

**How to Value Equity:**

**For Public Companies:**
- RSUs have clear value
- Divide total grant by vesting years
- Assume 80-90% of current value (accounts for risk)

**For Startups:**
- Options are risky
- Most options expire worthless
- Value at 10-30% of paper value
- Exception: Very late-stage startups

**Example:**
```
Startup offers 10,000 options at $1 strike
Current share price: $5
Paper value: $40,000

Conservative valuation: $4,000-$12,000
(10-30% of paper value)
```

**Don't trade significant salary for early-stage equity unless:**
- You believe deeply in the company
- You can afford the risk
- You understand the cap table
- You've researched the terms

## The Salary Discussion Timeline

Timing is everything in salary negotiation.

### Stage 1: Initial Contact (Recruiter Reach Out)

**They Ask:** "What are your salary expectations?"

**You Say:**
```
"I'm focused on finding the right role and team fit first. Once we
determine there's a mutual match, I'm confident we can find a
compensation package that works for both of us. What's the range
budgeted for this role?"
```

**Or:**
```
"Based on my research for [role] in [location] with my experience
level, I'm seeing ranges of [range]. Does this role fall within
that range?"
```

**Don't:**
- Give a specific number first
- Share your current/previous salary
- Low-ball yourself to seem affordable

**Why This Works:**
- Deflects without being evasive
- Shows you're informed
- Gets them to share range first
- Keeps options open

### Stage 2: Application/First Interview

**They Ask:** "What are your salary requirements?"

**You Say:**
```
"I'd prefer to learn more about the role and responsibilities before
discussing specific numbers. I'm sure if we're a mutual fit, we'll
be able to agree on fair compensation. What range is budgeted for
this position?"
```

**Or (if pressed):**
```
"Based on my research and experience, I'm targeting roles in the
[range]. But I'm flexible depending on the total compensation package
and growth opportunities."
```

**On Applications:**
- If required: Enter your target range or "negotiable"
- Some applications force a number: Use high end of your range
- Never enter your current salary

### Stage 3: Deeper Interviews

**They Ask:** "What's your current salary?"

**You Say:**
```
"I'd prefer to focus on the value I can bring to this role rather
than my previous compensation, as they're quite different positions.
I'm targeting [range] based on market research for this type of role."
```

**In Some States (CA, NY, etc.):**
It's illegal for them to ask your current salary.

**You Say:**
```
"I appreciate you asking, but I understand that question isn't
permitted in [state]. I'm happy to discuss my target range for
this role instead."
```

**Keep Deferring Until Offer:**
- "I'd like to see the full offer before discussing specifics"
- "Let's make sure we're a mutual fit first"
- "What's the range for this position?"

### Stage 4: Offer Received

**This is when you negotiate.**

Not before.

**They Say:** "We'd like to offer you the position at $X salary..."

**You Say:**
```
"Thank you so much! I'm excited about the opportunity. Can you send
me the full offer details in writing so I can review everything
carefully? I'd like to see the complete compensation package including
benefits, equity, and any other details."
```

**Then:**
- Review thoroughly
- Do your research
- Prepare your counter
- Take 2-3 days minimum

**Never Accept on the Spot:**
```
"I appreciate the offer! Can I take a few days to review everything
carefully? When would you like my response by?"
```

## How to Negotiate: The Process

You have the offer. Now what?

### Step 1: Review the Offer (Day 1)

**What to Review:**

**Compensation:**
- Base salary
- Bonus structure and targets
- Equity details and vesting
- Total compensation calculation

**Benefits:**
- Health insurance (coverage and cost)
- 401k match percentage
- PTO days
- Sick leave
- Parental leave
- Life/disability insurance

**Other Terms:**
- Start date
- Remote work policy
- Equipment provided
- Relocation assistance
- Signing bonus
- Education/conference budget

**Red Flags:**
- Below market salary with vague equity
- Unusual vesting (5+ year cliff)
- Limited benefits
- Unreasonable non-compete
- Required relocation without support

### Step 2: Do Your Research (Day 1-2)

**Compare to Market:**
- Is base salary competitive?
- Is total comp in range?
- How does equity compare?
- Are benefits standard?

**Calculate Your Position:**
```
Their Offer: $90,000
Market Range: $85,000-$110,000
Your Target: $100,000

Gap: $10,000
Their offer is: Below target, above minimum
```

**Consider:**
- Do you have competing offers?
- How badly do you want this role?
- What's your leverage?
- What's your minimum?

### Step 3: Prepare Your Counter (Day 2-3)

**Decide What to Negotiate:**

**Prioritize:**
1. Base salary (most important)
2. Signing bonus (one-time boost)
3. Equity (if significant)
4. PTO (quality of life)
5. Remote work (if relevant)
6. Start date (flexibility)

**Don't Negotiate Everything:**
Pick your top 2-3 priorities.

**Build Your Case:**

**Weak:**
```
"I was hoping for more money."
```

**Strong:**
```
"I'm excited about this role. Based on my research and conversations
with others in similar positions, the market rate for this role in
Austin is $95k-$110k. Given my 2 years of React experience and my
track record of building scalable applications, I was targeting
$100k. Is there flexibility in the salary?"
```

**Strong (with competing offer):**
```
"I'm very excited about this opportunity and you're my top choice.
However, I do have another offer at $105k. I'd love to make this
work. Is there flexibility to get closer to that number?"
```

### Step 4: Make Your Counter (Day 3)

**Schedule a Call:**
Email is fine, but phone/video is better for negotiation.

**Your Email:**

```
Subject: [Your Name] - Offer Discussion

Hi [Hiring Manager],

Thank you again for the offer to join the team as a [Role]. I'm very
excited about the opportunity to work on [specific project/team] and
contribute to [company goal].

I've had a chance to review the offer carefully, and I was hoping we
could discuss the compensation package. Would you have 15-20 minutes
for a call this week?

I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

**The Call:**

**Opening:**
```
"Thanks for taking the time to talk. I want to start by saying I'm
really excited about this opportunity. [Company] is my top choice,
and I can see myself making a significant impact on [specific area]."
```

**Your Counter:**
```
"I've done research on market rates for this role, and I was hoping
we could discuss the base salary. Based on [specific reasons], I was
targeting [target salary]. Is there flexibility there?"
```

**If They Ask Your Number:**
```
"I was hoping for [target salary], but I'm flexible if we can
discuss the total package."
```

**Other Items:**
```
"I also wanted to ask about [PTO/remote work/signing bonus]. Is
there any flexibility there?"
```

**Closing:**
```
"I'm really excited to join the team, and I'm confident we can find
a package that works for both of us. What are the next steps?"
```

### Step 5: Handle Their Response

**Response 1: "Yes"**
```
"That works! We can do [your number]."
```

**You Say:**
```
"That's great! Thank you for working with me on this. I'm excited
to join the team. What are the next steps?"
```

**Response 2: "Meet in the Middle"**
```
"We can't do [your number], but we can do [middle number]."
```

**If Acceptable:**
```
"I appreciate you working with me. If we can also [other item], I'm
ready to accept. Does that work?"
```

**If Not Acceptable:**
```
"I appreciate that. Is there any additional flexibility on salary,
or could we look at [signing bonus/equity/PTO] instead?"
```

**Response 3: "No"**
```
"Unfortunately, we can't increase the salary. It's our final offer."
```

**You Say:**
```
"I understand. Let me think it over and get back to you by [date].
If salary is fixed, is there flexibility on [signing bonus/equity/
start date]?"
```

**Response 4: "Let Me Check"**
```
"Let me talk to [leadership] and get back to you."
```

**You Say:**
```
"Of course, I understand. When should I expect to hear back?"
```

### Step 6: Make Your Decision

**If They Met Your Target:**
Accept! You got what you wanted.

**If They're Close:**
Decide if the difference is worth it:
- Is the role great?
- Is the company great?
- Are the other benefits strong?
- Is this your best option?

**If They Didn't Budge:**
- Is it still above your minimum?
- Are there other reasons to take it?
- Do you have better options?
- Can you accept strategically and plan to move later?

**If Below Your Minimum:**
Walk away. It's okay.

```
"Thank you for considering my request. After careful thought, I don't
think I can make this work at the current compensation level. I really
appreciate your time and hope we can work together in the future."
```

## Common Negotiation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Accepting the First Offer

**Why It's a Mistake:**
- Leaves money on the table

Always negotiate something, even if you're happy with the salary.

### Mistake 2: Giving a Number First

**Fix:**
Defer and ask for their range first.

Only mention offers you actually have.

### Mistake 4: Negotiating Too Hard

**Why It's a Mistake:**

- Not relevant to business case
- Weakens your position
- Can seem entitled

**Bad:**
"I need $X because I have student loans / rent is high / etc."

### Mistake 9: Being Vague

**Why It's a Mistake:**
- Unclear what you want
- Easy to dismiss

## Negotiating Your First Raise

You negotiated your starting salary. Now what about raises?

### When to Ask for a Raise

**Good Times:**

- After major accomplishment
- After taking on new responsibilities
- When role has significantly changed
- When you receive external offer

**Bad Times:**
- Company layoffs or financial trouble
- You just got a raise
- Before proving yourself
- During company crisis

### How to Ask for a Raise

**Preparation (1-2 Months Before):**

**Document Your Achievements:**
```
- Led migration to TypeScript, reducing bugs by 40%
- Shipped 3 major features ahead of schedule
- Mentored 2 junior developers
- Improved performance metrics by 30%
- Took on additional responsibilities [list]
```

**Research Market Rates:**
- Has your market value increased?
- What are similar roles paying?
- What's your current gap?

**Determine Your Ask:**
- What's your target increase?
- What's your minimum?
- What's reasonable given performance?

**The Conversation:**

**Schedule Time:**
```
"Hi [Manager], I'd like to schedule time to discuss my compensation
and career progression. Do you have 30 minutes in the next week or two?"
```

**Opening:**
```
"Thanks for making time. I've been with the company for [time] now,
and I'm proud of what we've accomplished together. I wanted to discuss
my compensation."
```

**Your Case:**
```
"Over the past [time period], I've [list major achievements]. I've
also taken on additional responsibilities in [areas].

Based on my research, the market rate for my current role and
experience level is [range], which is [X%] higher than my current
salary.

Given my performance and contributions, I'd like to discuss adjusting
my compensation to [target], which would be [X%] increase. What are
your thoughts?"
```

**Handling Responses:**

**If Yes:**
```
"Thank you for recognizing my contributions. I'm excited to continue
making an impact."
```

**If Not Now:**
```
"I understand. What would need to happen for us to revisit this
conversation? And what's a reasonable timeline?"
```

**If No:**
```
"I appreciate you being transparent. Can you help me understand the
reasoning? And what would need to change for this to be possible in
the future?"
```

## Final Thoughts

Negotiation isn't just about money. It's about:
- Understanding your value
- Advocating for yourself
- Setting precedent for your career
- Building confidence
- Creating fair relationships

**Remember:**
- Companies negotiate for themselves every day
- You have more leverage than you think
- Reasonable negotiation is expected
- One conversation can change your trajectory
- You're not being greedy, you're being professional

**The developers who earn more aren't always the most skilled. They're often the ones who negotiate effectively.**

Your worth isn't just what you can do. It's also your ability to advocate for yourself.

Now go get what you're worth.
