## 💡 Study Tips

### 1. Build While You Learn
Don't just watch tutorials. Code along, then build something similar on your own.

### 2. Use the 70/20/10 Rule
- 70% building projects
- 20% learning new concepts
- 10% reviewing and refining

### 3. Learn in Public
- Share your progress on Twitter/LinkedIn
- Write blog posts about what you learned
- Help others in Discord/Reddit

### 4. Focus on One Thing at a Time
Master each concept before moving on. Better to know React deeply than React, Vue, and Angular superficially.

### 5. Join Communities
- Reactiflux Discord
- r/webdev and r/reactjs on Reddit
- Frontend Developers Twitter
- Local meetups

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Tutorial Hell
**Problem**: Endlessly watching tutorials without building.
**Solution**: Build a project after every 2-3 tutorials.

### 2. Learning Too Many Things at Once
**Problem**: Trying to learn React, Vue, Angular, Svelte simultaneously.
**Solution**: Master one stack (JS → React → Next.js) before exploring.

### 3. Not Building a Portfolio
**Problem**: Learning without showcasing.
**Solution**: Build and deploy projects from day one.

### 4. Skipping Fundamentals
**Problem**: Jumping to React without knowing JavaScript.
**Solution**: Follow this roadmap in order.

### 5. Perfectionism
**Problem**: Not applying until everything is "perfect."
**Solution**: Apply when you can build functional projects, not when you know everything.
