# React Fundamentals

Now that you understand JavaScript (and TypeScript), it's time for React—the tool that lets you build modern, dynamic web apps. This section is about connecting the dots: not just how to use React, but why each piece fits the way it does.

## What We'll Cover

1. **Your First Component** - The building block of everything in React
2. **Props and Children** - How data flows into components
3. **State and useState** - Making your UI interactive and dynamic
4. **Rendering Lists** - Displaying arrays of data efficiently
5. **Handling Events** - Responding to user interactions
6. **useEffect and Data Fetching** - Working with side effects and APIs
7. **Lifting State Up** - Sharing data between components
8. **Essential Hooks** - The toolkit for modern React
9. **Component Composition Patterns** - Building complex UIs from simple pieces
10. **Job-Ready Project Patterns** - Real-world patterns used in production apps

## The Pattern You'll See

Every feature in React solves a real problem. We'll show you the problem first, then React's solution, so you understand **why** it exists—not just how to use it.

You'll see code first, explanations second. You'll learn common mistakes before they bite you. And you'll connect each concept to the ones before it, building a complete mental model of how React works.

By the end of this section, you won't just know React syntax. You'll understand **why** React does things the way it does, and you'll be ready to build real applications.

Let's start with the foundation: components.
